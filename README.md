## Welcome!

The purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase my experience and the projects I have worked on.

- Movie Recommendation Engine - full-stack app (Flask + Vue.js) that I developed using the publicly available IMDb movie ratings dataset in my spare time

- RetrofitAI - Virtual Audit Engine that I built at EnergyX Solutions which now enables millions of homeowners across North America to save money on their energy bills 

- 3D Blood Vessel Growth Simulator - Simulation software that I created using open-source computational biology tools as part of my Master's Thesis at the University of Toronto.
