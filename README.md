## Welcome!

The purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase my experience and the main projects I have worked on. 

Namely,

- RetrofitAI - Virtual Audit Engine that I built at EnergyX Solutions which now enables millions of homeowners across North America to save money on their heating bills &

- Blood Vessel Growth in Tumour Environements - Simulation Software that I built during my Master's Thesis at the University of Toronto.
