## Welcome!

The purpose of this portfolio website(https://github.com/kuzmicni/kuzmicni.github.io) is to showcase my experience and the main projects I have worked on. 

Namely,

- RetrofitAI - Virtual Audit Engine that I built at EnergyX Solutions which now enables millions of homeowners across North America to save money on their heating bills &

- Blood Vessel Growth in Tumour Environements - Simulation Software that I built during my Master's Thesis at University of Toronto.
